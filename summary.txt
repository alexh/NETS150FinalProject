Our project collects data from a digital card game Hearthstone. Hearthstone is a turned
based card game where players can choose to play as one of nine classes and we are trying to find out which class is the most optimal class to play. We collected data from http://www.vicioussyndicate.com/drr/matchup-chart-data-reaper-report/ and put them into a txt file. Our program parses the txt file, construct a graph from the data and runs pagerank on the graph to find the most optimal class to play. We produced visual graphs and raw data for the users to copy or understand from. 

The category we took from above is graph and graph algorithms. Data structures for constructing a graph were written, so that pagerank could be run on the dataset. From the pagerank, we marked the vertex with the most pagerank as the most optimal class because it has the most "flow" from all the other vertices.

Empirical Analysis -  

Hypotheses that you proved/disproved - Our hypothesis is that Hearthstone is that despite the discrepancies in the win rates among different decks, Hearthstone is still a fair game because only a small number decks will have a higher average win rates. Due to the nature of the game having large number of characters, there will be some decks whose attributes that arenâ€™t fully balanced with other decks. In addition, the emergence of popular deck strategies from time to time will some strength and weaknesses in decks that were not known before to the game developers. Although attributes of decks does play a major role in game, human strategy is still a big portion of determining win rates. Therefore, even if a player chooses a deck with higher average win rates, there are counter strategies and it does not necessarily mean the player is more likely to win.

Who did what:
Alex Haynes - python graph (readable graph under the drawing folder), pagerank algorithm, graph data structures, parsing the file
Henry Zhu - writeup except for Empricial Analysis section, interactive graph (messy, but moveable), recording 1/2 of the data from the website into the txt file, bar graph of pagerank
Will Yeung - recording the rest of the data from the website into the txt file
